# Background and Overview

The primary objective of this analysis was to explore SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in Pennsylvania wastewater samples. This project focused on understanding the distribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the viral genome and how they varied across geographic locations, sampling techniques, and temporal trends. Using publicly available sequencing data and associated metadata, we sought to answer the following research question:

How does the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples correlate with population size, sampling methods, and geographic location over time?

To address this question, we employed a bioinformatics workflow that integrated raw VCF files, GFF annotations, and population metadata. The analyses were performed using custom R scripts, including functions provided by the instructor, and the outputs were used to generate informative figures and tables. The results demonstrated clear spatial and temporal patterns in SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and identified genes with significant SNP counts.



# Methods
Custom R functions provided by the instructor were used for key data processing steps:

1.read_gff: Read and parsed the GFF genome annotation file to extract genomic regions of interest.
2.extract_genes_from_gff: Filtered and cleaned the GFF data to produce a gene table containing genomic coordinates and gene names.
3.parse_tidy_and_stack_vcfs: Processed and combined multiple VCF files into a single tidy dataset, adding sample-specific metadata.
4.add_genes_metadata_to_vcfstack: Annotated SNPs with gene information by merging the tidy VCF data with the cleaned gene table and sequencing metadata.

See the set of tutorials on the [vcfR package website](https://knausb.github.io/vcfR_documentation/index.html).

**Figure 1**:Temporal Trends in Normalized Sequencing Coverage Over Time in Pennsylvania
The plot shows normalized sequencing coverage (SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels per person) over time for wastewater samples collected in Pennsylvania. Peaks in sequencing coverage may reflect variations in viral prevalence, sampling methods, or population size adjustments. The data are normalized to account for differences in population size represented by each sample.
