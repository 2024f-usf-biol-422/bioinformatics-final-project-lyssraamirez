**Figure 1**:Temporal Trends in Normalized Sequencing Coverage Over Time in Pennsylvania
The plot shows normalized sequencing coverage (SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels per person) over time for wastewater samples collected in Pennsylvania. Peaks in sequencing coverage may reflect variations in viral prevalence, sampling methods, or population size adjustments. The data are normalized to account for differences in population size represented by each sample.

data <- read.csv(params$sra_runtable_path)

```
**Figure 2:**Impact of Sampling Methods on Normalized SARS-CoV-2 Sequencing Coverage
The left box plot compares sequencing coverage per person across different sampling matrices (e.g., "post grit removal" vs. "raw wastewater"). The right boxplot compares sequencing coverage per person across sampling types (e.g., "composite" vs. "grab"). Composite samples show higher variability in SARS-CoV-2 detection, likely due to their ability to aggregate data over time, while raw wastewater samples may retain higher RNA integrity. These comparisons highlight the influence of methodological choices on viral prevalence estimates.

**Figure 3:** Correlation Between Population Size and Sequencing Coverage in Wastewater Samples
The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between population size and sequencing coverage (SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels) in wastewater samples. A linear regression line is included to assess trends and the strength of correlation. Points are colored by collection date to explore temporal changes in the relationship.

**Table 1**: Gene names, locations, and lengths in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Higher SNP counts in the S and N genes may be related to the larger size of these genes.
