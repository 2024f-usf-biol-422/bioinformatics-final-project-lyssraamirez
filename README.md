# Genomic Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 Variants in Pennsylvania Wastewater: Insights into Epidemiological Trends
Research question: How do SARS-CoV-2 variants detected in wastewater reflect regional trends in COVID-19 case counts, and what insights do these data provide about community-level viral transmission?

# Source
Accession: PRJNA1039783 ID: 1039783
I have chosen metadata from "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",submitted by the PA Department of Health Bureau of Laboratories Submission Group. I also plan on comparing different counties in Pensylvania: Allegheny County,Capital Region Water(Dauphin County),Erie County and Indiana Borough.(Indiana County)

# Overall goals
The goal to use R Markdown, Git/GitHub, and Linux command-line skills through careful analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data from wastewater samples and COVID-19 case data in Pensylvania. The research question will be proven by comparing and contrasting sequencing data of SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater samples and variant frequencies reported in particular regions with large populations. I will also be looking into how the filtration of water systems affect the cleanliness and pureness of waterwaste that is recycled for public use.
